\ Test out POSIX-SIGACTION.
\ Does so by establishing a handler for SIGINT and then going into
\ an infinite loop.  If all is well, if a SIGINT is received then
\ a message of the form
\
\   caught signal 2
\
\ should be output.  This will continue until the process is killed.
\ If you run this inside Shell Mode in GNU Emacs then an easy way to
\ send SIGINT is just to type C-c C-c.  To terminate the program
\ send in some other signal, e.g. SIGQUIT (C-c C-\ in Emacs).
\
\ Run it by doing
\
\ ./okf test/test-posix-sigaction.okf

\ The argument to a signal handler comes through on %esp, so 
\ the following copies it from there to the parameter stack.
\ See bib.linux.sig.handler.
